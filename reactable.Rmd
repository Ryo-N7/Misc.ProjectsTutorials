## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(reactable)
library(DT)
```




```{r}
reactable(iris[1:5, ], columns = list(
  Sepal.Length = colDef(name = "Sepal Length"),
  Sepal.Width = colDef(name = "Sepal Width"),
  Species = colDef(align = "center")
))
```



```{r}
datatable(head(iris), colnames = c('Another Better Name' = 2, 'Yet Another Name' = 4))
```
